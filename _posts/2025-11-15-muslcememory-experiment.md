## 🧬 **Introduction — Why I'm Doing This Experiment**

Three months ago, I stopped going to the gym. I was heavily stressed out due to academic pressure and a lack of time. I know it might sound like an excuse, but it’s the truth. Even though I wasn’t completely inactive — I still did pull-ups and push-ups at home — my real, consistent training stopped in August.

Because I wasn’t working out properly *and* wasn’t maintaining enough protein intake or overall nutrition, here’s what happened:

- Bodyweight dropped from **70.2 kg → 61 kg**
- Muscle mass decreased
- Bench press strength fell dramatically
- My old 1RM of **85 kg** now feels far away

But here’s the interesting part:
 If **muscle memory is real**, my strength and muscle size should return *much faster* than when I first trained.

It originally took me at least **6–7 months** of consistent training to reach an 85 kg 1RM. With muscle memory, I should be able to approach that number again in a much shorter period.

So I decided to turn this entire process into a **personal experiment** and document everything publicly.



## 🤓  Background research

Before we start, what exactly is "muscle memory"? 



Muscle memory is the ability to perform movements automatically without consciously thinking about each step. According to the Cleveland Clinic, this form of memory is **not actually stored in the muscles**, but in the brain — specifically in the **motor cortex, cerebellum, and striatum**, which handle procedural (implicit) memory.

When you repeatedly practice a movement, your muscles adapt by increasing **myonuclei** inside muscle fibers. These extra nuclei remain even after you stop training, allowing muscles to regain size and strength more quickly when you resume — this is why retraining is much faster than starting from zero.

Muscle memory develops in **three stages**:

1. **Cognitive Phase** — you think through each step.
2. **Associative Phase** — performance improves with practice.
3. **Autonomous Phase** — the movement becomes automatic.

Most importantly, the studies suggest that **previously trained muscles regain size and strength significantly faster due to retained myonuclei.**

**🤯 “Half the time” rule?!?!**

Since I can’t fully trust the source, let’s dig into this further!

First, I used ChatGPT to check if this is valid. ~~*Using AI to check AI* 🤣~~



GPT's response: 
![Screenshot 2025-11-16 at 2.38.03 PM](/assets/images/2025-11-15-muslcememory-experiment/Screenshot 2025-11-16 at 2.38.03 PM.png)

I couldn't find every sources that my GPT told me, but I found a reliable source that showed the studies by 

**Staron (1991):** The researchers had participants train for 20 weeks, detrain for 30-32 weeks, and then retrain. The participants **regained their lost strength in only 6 weeks**—a fraction of the original 20-week training time. 



The Staron study showed results that were significantly *better* than that rule. Anyway, whats important is that, If the muscle memory is true, it would take less than 2 months to regain my power 🏋️. 



## 🎯 **Goal of the Experiment**

> **To measure how quickly I regain strength, muscle, and performance after a 3-month detraining period.**

Specifically:

- How fast does my **bench press** recover?

- Does my **5RM / 1RM estimate** jump rapidly?

- How quickly does my **bodyweight and muscle mass** rebound?

  

This experiment will test the real-world effect of **muscle memory** caused by preserved myonuclei.



## 🏋️‍♂️ **My Peak Condition (Before Detraining)**

| Metric               | Peak Value    |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Bodyweight           | **70.2 kg**   |
| Skeletal Muscle Mass | **34.8 kg**   |
| Bench Press 1RM      | **85 kg**     |
| Training Frequency   | 4–5 days/week |



## 📉 **My Condition After 3-Month Detraining (Now)**

| Metric               | Current Value (Nov 16, 2025)                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Bodyweight           | **61 kg**                                     |
| Muscle Mass          | noticeably lower                              |
| Bench Press Strength | unknown (estimated 60–70 kg range)            |
| Activity             | Only push-ups & pull-ups at home. 2 days/week |



## 🧪 **Experiment Design**

### **Phase 1 — Initial Measurement (Day 0)**

I will record:

- Current **bodyweight, muscle mass**
- Current **5RM on bench press**
- Predicted **1RM** using Brzycki & Epley formulas

> **Reason:** True 1RM is dangerous after detraining, so 5RM is safer and scientifically accurate.

------

### **Phase 2 — Retraining**

**Training frequency:** 4-5 days/week
Sticking with the previous routine:

skipping legday😏

**Monday** **(chestday)**

- Bench Press: 10 reps, 3-4 sets
- Dips: 10 reps, 3-4 sets
- Push-ups: until failure

**Tuesday (backday)**

- Lat-pulldown: 10 reps, 3-4 sets
- Pull ups: until failure

**Wednesday (shoulder, chestday)**

- Dumbbell Shoulder press: 10 reps, 3-4 sets
- Side lateral raise: 10 reps, 3-4 sets
- Push-ups / Bench Press

**Thursday (back, shoulderday)**

- Pull ups / Lat-pulldown: 10 reps, 3-4 sets
- Bent-over raise: 10 reps, 3-4 sets

**Saturday (optional. overall workout)**



------

### **Phase 3 — Weekly Testing**

Every 7 days:

- Test bench **4 - 5RM**
- Recalculate **1RM estimate**
- Measure bodyweight, muscle mass

------

### **Phase 4 — Analysis**

with this I would be able to compare:

- How quickly strength returns
- How fast muscle mass comes back
- Whether the progress is faster than beginner gains
- Whether the recovery rate slows or accelerates over weeks



# 📈 Expected Results

| Week       | Predicted Bench 1RM | Predicted Bodyweight | Predicted Muscle Mass* | Notes                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Day 0**  | ~65 kg              | 61 kg                | + 0 kg                 | Initial test. Nervous system is “cold.” Muscle flatness from glycogen loss. |
| **Week 1** | 72.5 kg             | 62.5 kg              | + 0.8 kg               | Rapid neural gains. Muscle mass rises quickly from glycogen, water, and early protein synthesis restart. |
| **Week 2** | 77.5 kg             | 63.5 kg              | + 1.5 kg               | “Muscle memory” kicks in. Myonuclei reactivate protein synthesis. Machines & free weight form improves. |
| **Week 3** | 80 kg               | 64.5 kg              | + 2.2 kg               | Approaching 94% of peak strength. Muscle regrowth is fast but stabilizing. |
| **Week 4** | 82.5 kg             | 65.5 kg              | + 2.8 kg               | Early newbie-like gains slow. Now steady hypertrophy returns. |
| **Week 5** | 84 kg               | 66 kg                | + 3.2 kg               | Very close to peak strength. Muscle mass approaching pre-detraining levels. |
| **Week 6** | **85 kg (Goal!)**   | 67 kg                | + 3.7 kg               | Peak strength (85 kg) likely regained. Muscle mass nearly identical to original 34.8 kg. |
| **Week 7** | 86 kg               | 67.5 kg              | + 4 kg                 | New PR territory begins. Slight hypertrophy beyond old peak. |
| **Week 8** | 87.5 kg             | 68 kg                | + 4.3 kg               | Strength gains normalize. Muscle mass slowly surpasses old best. |

**Critical Factors for This Outcome**

This hypothesis depends on three key factors that I must control for in the experiment:

1. **Caloric Surplus:** I cannot regain 9.2 kg of mass (from 61 kg back to 70.2 kg) without eating in a consistent caloric surplus. the strength gains will stall if my bodyweight doesn't increase, as the peak strength us tied to the peak mass.

2. **High Protein Intake:** I must consume adequate protein (e.g., 1.6-2.2 grams per kg of bodyweight) to provide the building blocks for muscle repair and growth.

3. **Consistency & Progressive Overload:** I must stick to the routine and focus on **progressive overload**—adding a little more weight or perhaps an extra rep whenever possible.

   

## 📊 **What I Will Publish Later**

After 2–4 weeks, I will upload:

- Graph of **1RM vs time**

- Graph of **Body weight vs time**

- Graph of **Muscle mass vs time**
