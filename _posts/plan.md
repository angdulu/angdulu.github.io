 While originally introduced in the context of molecular speed distributions,
 this framework also explains temperature-dependent reaction rates by linking
 the fraction of molecules exceeding activation energy to collision theory.

## Update — Extending to Kinetics (Unit 5)

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution does more than describe how fast molecules move—it also provides a molecular-level explanation for temperature-dependent reaction rates.

For a reaction to occur, colliding molecules must possess kinetic energy greater than or equal to the activation energy (Eₐ). On a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution curve, this corresponds to the area under the curve beyond Eₐ. As temperature increases, the distribution shifts to the right and flattens, increasing the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier.

This directly explains why reaction rates increase with temperature: not because molecules collide more often alone, but because a greater proportion of collisions are energetically successful. In this way, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution provides the statistical foundation for collision theory and the rate laws studied in chemical kinetics.
