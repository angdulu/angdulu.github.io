# AP Chem U3 Gas

The **Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution** shows how particle **velocities** are distributed in a gas.

For the same gas at different temperatures, the curve broadens and shifts to higher velocity as **temperature increases**, because 
the average Kinetic Energy is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. 


$$
\text{average KE} = \tfrac{1}{2} m \bar{v}^2 \propto T
$$

$$
\text{average KE} = \tfrac{1}{2} m_1 \bar{v_1}^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 \bar{v_2}^2
$$

For the different gas at same temperature, the curve narrows down and shifts to lower speeds as molar mass increases, because for an equal average Kinetic Energy, higher molar mass indicates lower velocity. 


$$
{m_1} > m_2
$$

$$
∴\bar{v_1}^2 <\bar{v_2}^2
$$
