The **Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution** shows how particle **velocities** are distributed in a gas.





## Same gas at different temperatures

For the **same gas at different temperatures**, the curve broadens and shifts to higher velocity as temperature increases, because the average Kinetic Energy is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. 

If gas 1 has higher temperature,


$$
\text{average KE} = \tfrac{1}{2} m {v}^2 \propto T
$$


$$
\text{average KE}_1  =\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 {v_1}^2 > \text{average KE}_2 =\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 {v_2}^2
$$

$$
m_1 = m_2
$$

$$
∴v_1 > v_2
$$

## Different gas at same temperature

For the **different gas at same temperature**, the curve narrows down and shifts to lower speeds as molar mass increases, because for an equal average Kinetic Energy, higher molar mass indicates lower velocity. 

If gas 1 has higher molar mass, 


$$
\text{average KE} = \tfrac{1}{2} m_1 {v_1}^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 {v_2}^2
$$


$$
{m_1} > m_2
$$

$$
∴v_1 <v_2
$$

⚠️ He molar mass > H molar mass
