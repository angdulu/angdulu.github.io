Hi! I’m Andrew Kim, an American–Korean student currently attending at a school in Jeju, South Korea.
 This post marks the **official start** of my blog — not just me testing out templates anymore, but actually sharing what I enjoy, learn, and create.



## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I’m planning to major in pre-med, and I’ve always loved math and science — especially chemistry and physics.
 Biology? Honestly… not my favorite. Too much memorization. But I’m trying to get better at it because it’s important — and I’m willing to learn.

I’m someone who likes trying new things, even when they’re totally outside my comfort zone.
 This blog is a perfect example — I’ve never learned coding in my life.
 Even though Jekyll is a pre-made template, I had no idea what I was doing. Editing `.html`, `.yml`, and all that stuff was a complete mystery.
 But with a mix of Google, ChatGPT, and YouTube, I somehow made it work. That’s what I love about tech — it gives people like me the power to build something from scratch (or almost scratch). I'm even using ChatGPT for this — checking grammar and telling it to add emojis. 😏



## ⚽🧠 What You’ll Find Here

This blog is where I’ll post everything I find fun or worth sharing:

- ⚽ **Soccer** — my thoughts, match reactions, maybe even tactics
- 🧪 **Math & Science** — problems, experiments, or just random “aha” moments
- 💻 **Coding & Blog Making** — things I learn while figuring out how websites work
- 🏋 **Other Stuff** — workouts, projects, and anything that makes me curious

I’m definitely 이과 (STEM) — not even close to 문과. But at least I’m bilingual, so that’s something. 😆

This blog is about curiosity, growth, and trying new things — one small post at a time.
 Welcome to my start.
