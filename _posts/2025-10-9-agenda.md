Hi! I’m Andrew Kim, an American–Korean student currently attending at a school in Jeju, South Korea.
 This post marks the **official start** of my blog: not just me testing out templates anymore, but actually sharing what I enjoy, learn, and create.



## About Me

I’m planning to major in pre-med, and I’ve always loved math and science. Especially chemistry and physics.
 Biology? Honestly… not my favorite. Too much memorization. But I’m trying to get better at it because it’s important and I’m willing to learn.

I’m someone who likes trying new things, even when they’re totally outside my comfort zone.
 This blog is a perfect example. I’ve never learned coding in my life.
 Even though Jekyll is a pre-made template, I had no idea what I was doing. Editing `.html`, `.yml`, and all that stuff was a complete mystery.
 But with a mix of Google, ChatGPT, and YouTube, I somehow made it work. That’s what I love about tech. It gives people like me the power to build something from scratch (or almost scratch). I'm even using ChatGPT for this to check grammar. 



##  What You’ll Find Here

This blog is where I’ll post everything I find fun or worth sharing:

-  **Soccer**:  my thoughts, match reactions, maybe even tactics
- **Math & Science**:  problems, experiments, or just random “aha” moments
- **Coding & Blog Making**:  things I learn while figuring out how websites work
-  **Other Stuff**:  workouts, projects, and anything that makes me curious

I’m definitely 이과 (STEM). Not even close to 문과. But at least I’m bilingual, so that’s something. 

This blog is about curiosity, growth, and trying new things, one small post at a time.
 Welcome to my start.
