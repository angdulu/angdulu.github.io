## How I Made This GitHub Blog (With Zero Coding Experience)

This is my **first official post**, and it’s about how this website was born.

Before this, I had never written a single line of code in my life.
 HTML? YAML? Markdown? — I had no clue what any of those were.
 But I’ve always liked trying new things, even when I have no idea what I’m doing.
 So when I found a **YouTube video** explaining how to make a blog using **GitHub Pages + Jekyll**, I thought:

> “Why not?”

## 💡Day 1

The video I followed was in Korean, explaining how to make a Jekyll-based blog on GitHub Pages.
 The tutorial made it sound *so* easy — “less than 10 minutes!” — but for me, it took hours… days actually. 😅

Still, I learned a lot:

- How to create a GitHub repository

- What `_config.yml` does — basically, your site’s brain

- How to edit posts by making `.md` (Markdown) files

  

> This consists the website.

It's acutally very simple.

For example, simply changing this code:

```
name :   "Your name"
```

into this:

```
name :   "Andrew Kim"
```

It adds your name. While this is just a sample, you can add anything you want by simply asking ChatGPT! I even tried adding an automatic dark mode feature — it didn’t work as I expected, but still, here's the thing: you can do whatever you want.

Even though the template (I used Minimal Mistakes) was already made, understanding how it all connects was a challenge.
 But after so many Google searches, YouTube rewinds, and ChatGPT questions, it finally worked. 🎉



## 🧩 Day 2 — Leveling Up

As i'm posting this, I’ve already learned so much more:

- 🖥 **Using a local server** to instantly preview small edits before pushing to GitHub

- 🖼 **Adding images easily** with **Typora**, a Markdown editor that lets me drag and drop images

- 🎨 **Changing themes and settings**, adding new features, and customizing layouts

  > It started as a plain white page. Now it’s finally starting to look like a *real* blog.

- 🔍 **Using Inspect (Dev Tools)** to tweak colors, layouts, and other styles directly from my browser

Every little experiment makes this site feel more like mine.
 There’s still a lot I don’t understand — but that’s what makes it fun.



## ✍️ What’s Next

There’s so much I want to share, but writing everything in Markdown takes forever 😅
 Each post means creating and typing inside a `.md` file, so it’s not as quick as a regular blog.
 Still, I’ll keep posting the things I find interesting — step by step, as I learn.

This is just the beginning.
 Day 1, 2 of many. 🚀



## ⚙️ Tools That Saved Me

Honestly, I owe this blog to:

- 🧠 **Google** — for every “why isn’t my site showing up” question

- 🤖 **ChatGPT** — for fixing broken syntax and checking grammar (like this post 😏)

- 🎥 **YouTube** — for the Korean tutorial that started it all

## 💬 What I Learned

- You don’t have to “know coding” to build something cool.

- Errors are part of the process — one typo can break everything, but fixing it teaches a lot.

- Building something yourself feels *way* better than just using a platform that’s already done for you.
