## Abstract 

Post-detraining “muscle memory” is often described qualitatively as rapid early recovery of strength that slows as prior performance is approached. This work develops a minimal, testable modeling framework for that claim. The central question is: given a pre-detraining performance level $S_T$ and a post-detraining level $S_D$, what functional form best describes the recovery trajectory $S(t)$ during retraining, and what data are required to distinguish candidate dynamics? Two first-principles ordinary differential equation models are formalized. A deficit-driven model assumes $\frac{dS}{dt}=k_r(S_T-S)$, yielding exponential closure of the performance deficit. A logistic alternative assumes $\frac{dS}{dt}=k_l S\left(1-\frac{S}{S_T}\right)$, implying nonlinear, state-dependent recovery toward the same target $S_T$. An identifiability analysis shows that, near $S_T$, the logistic model linearizes to the same exponential deficit decay, implying that sparse endpoint measurements cannot discriminate mechanisms. The framework is applied to three published human training–detraining–retraining datasets (young adults and older adults) to extract recovery fractions and rate constraints. Across outcomes, recovery to within reported test–retest error can occur within $\sim\!5$ weeks, but overshoot and strength–size dissociations highlight where the fixed-target assumption breaks. 

## Introduction

**Research question.** After a period of detraining, individuals often regain strength faster than they initially built it. The practical problem is quantitative: if a person had pre-detraining performance $S_T$, dropped to $S_D$ after detraining, and then begins retraining at $t=0$, what is a defensible mathematical form for $S(t)$ during recovery—and what observations would allow one to choose among competing forms?

**Hypothesis (deficit-driven recovery).** The simplest mechanistic hypothesis consistent with “fast early regain, then slowing” is that recovery rate is proportional to the remaining deficit from the prior level:
$$
\frac{dS}{dt}\propto (S_T-S(t)).
$$
This produces an exponential approach toward $S_T$, with the deficit shrinking at a constant fractional rate.

**Competing hypothesis (logistic recovery).** A second minimal model is logistic growth toward a carrying capacity $S_T$, with recovery rate proportional to current state and remaining capacity:
$$
\frac{dS}{dt}=k_l S\!\left(1-\frac{S}{S_T}\right).
$$
A key objective is not only to write these models, but to determine whether typical human retraining datasets (often sparse) can actually distinguish them. 

## Physiological Background

Strength recovery after detraining is not a single biological process. Two recurring features matter for modeling:

1. **Strength can persist when size does not.** In young adults, muscle thickness and fiber size can return toward baseline during detraining while strength remains elevated, consistent with durable neural/motor-learning components. This creates an immediate warning: “strength” and “muscle size” may require different targets or rate parameters even when the same training intervention is used. 
2. **Retraining often restores prior levels quickly.** In a long, multi-timepoint intervention (periodic vs continuous resistance training), group means for strength and ultrasound CSA regained to approximately prior training-period levels within the first $\sim$5 weeks of retraining. That empirical regularity motivates a compact recovery model while simultaneously stressing the need to define what “recovered” means under measurement error. 

These points justify two modeling decisions used below:
 (i) define $S(t)$ generically (it may be 1RM, CSA, or another outcome), and
 (ii) treat “recovery” as approaching a target within an error tolerance, not necessarily as reaching it exactly. 

## Model Development

### Variables and normalization

Let

- $t$ = time since retraining begins (weeks), with $t=0$ at the end of detraining,
- $S(t)$ = outcome of interest (e.g., 1RM strength, muscle CSA),
- $S_T$ = outcome level at the end of the initial training block (pre-detraining “target”),
- $S_D$ = outcome level immediately after detraining.

Define the **normalized recovery fraction**:
$$
R(t)=\frac{S(t)-S_D}{S_T-S_D},
$$
so $R(0)=0$ and $R(t)=1$ corresponds to returning to $S_T$.

This normalization is conceptually important because it removes units and allows cross-study comparison when different exercises and scales are used.

### Model 1: Deficit-driven exponential recovery

**Assumption.** Recovery rate is proportional to the remaining deficit $S_T-S(t)$:
$$
\boxed{\frac{dS}{dt}=k_r\big(S_T-S(t)\big)},\quad k_r>0.
$$
**Solution.**
$$
\boxed{S(t)=S_T-(S_T-S_D)e^{-k_r t}}.
$$
Equivalently, in normalized form:
$$
\boxed{R_{\exp}(t)=1-e^{-k_r t}}.
$$
**Interpretation.** $k_r$ sets the timescale: the deficit shrinks by a factor $e^{-k_r}$ per week.

------

### Model 2: Logistic recovery toward $S_T$

**Assumption.** Recovery is proportional to current state and remaining “capacity”:
$$
\boxed{\frac{dS}{dt}=k_l S\left(1-\frac{S}{S_T}\right)},\quad k_l>0.
$$
**Solution.** With $S(0)=S_D$,
$$
\boxed{
S(t)=\frac{S_T}{1+\left(\frac{S_T-S_D}{S_D}\right)e^{-k_l t}}
}.
$$

### Analytical comparison 

#### 1) Same local behavior near $S_T$ (identifiability issue)

Let $x(t)=S_T-S(t)$ be the deficit. Under the logistic model:
$$
\frac{dS}{dt}=k_l(S_T-x)\left(1-\frac{S_T-x}{S_T}\right)=k_l(S_T-x)\frac{x}{S_T}.
$$
Thus
$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=-\frac{dS}{dt}=-k_l x\left(1-\frac{x}{S_T}\right)\approx -k_l x \quad \text{when } x\ll S_T.
$$
So **near the target**, logistic deficit decay is approximately exponential with rate $k_l$. This implies a hard constraint: if a dataset only samples retraining at one endpoint close to $S_T$, **both models will fit essentially equally well**, because they share the same first-order behavior near recovery.

#### 2) Different initial slope structure

At $t=0$,

- Exponential model:

$$
\left.\frac{dS}{dt}\right|_{0}=k_r(S_T-S_D).
$$

- Logistic model:

$$
\left.\frac{dS}{dt}\right|_{0}=k_l S_D\left(1-\frac{S_D}{S_T}\right)=k_l\frac{S_D}{S_T}(S_T-S_D).
$$

Both scale with the deficit $(S_T-S_D)$, but logistic introduces an extra factor $\frac{S_D}{S_T}$. When $S_D\approx S_T$ (small detraining loss), $\frac{S_D}{S_T}\approx 1$ and the models become even less distinguishable.

#### 3) Practical discrimination criterion

To discriminate the models empirically, one needs **multiple** retraining measurements **while $S(t)$ remains meaningfully below $S_T$** (large deficit regime), because that is where curvature/inflection differences emerge. Otherwise, the problem is mathematically underdetermined even if the narrative differences (“exponential vs logistic”) sound substantial.



If a dense retraining time series is available, exponential recovery predicts linearity in
$$
\ln(1 - R(t)) = -k_r t
$$
over the recovery window, whereas logistic recovery predicts linearity in
$$
\ln\!\left(\frac{S_T}{S(t)} - 1\right) = -k_l t + C.
$$
These diagnostics enable model discrimination when multiple early retraining observations are available and $S(t) < S_T$ holds throughout the fitting interval.



## Data & Observations

### Data strategy

A fully controlled personal experiment (weekly strength tests, nutrition control, repeated measures of muscle mass) is feasible in principle but high-burden in practice. The modeling investigation therefore treats published training–detraining–retraining datasets as the primary quantitative evidence, using the personal design mainly to define variables and measurement logic.

### Dataset A: Multi-timepoint retraining with reported measurement error (Halonen et al., 2024)

Periodic resistance training (PRT): 10-week training $\rightarrow$ 10-week detraining $\rightarrow$ 10-week retraining, with measurements every 5 weeks. Table values below use:

- $S_T=$ Week 10 (end of first training block),
- $S_D=$ Week 20 (end of detraining),
- $S(5\text{w})=$ Week 25 (after 5 weeks retraining). 

Test–retest measurement error (coefficient of variation, CV%) is reported for leg press 1RM, biceps curl 1RM, and ultrasound CSA outcomes. 

### Dataset B: Young adults, strength–size dissociation (Psilander et al., 2019)

Unilateral 10-week training (memory leg) $\rightarrow$ 20-week detraining $\rightarrow$ 5-week retraining. Reported group means show:

- Strength increased during training, remained partially elevated after detraining, and increased again during retraining. 
- Muscle thickness returned toward baseline during detraining and then increased again during retraining. 

### Dataset C: Older adults, 12-week retraining endpoint (Taaffe et al., 2009)

Resistance training (24 weeks) $\rightarrow$ detraining (24 weeks) $\rightarrow$ retraining (12 weeks). Exercise 1RM values are reported at each phase, enabling endpoint recovery fraction calculations for several exercises. 

## Model Evaluation

### 1) Recovery timing and overshoot: evidence for rapid regain + fixed-target breakdown

Using Halonen et al. (PRT group), Week 25 values return to (or slightly exceed) Week 10 values across strength and CSA outcomes. 
 However, **both the exponential and logistic models with a fixed $S_T$** predict a monotone approach to $S_T$ and do not naturally generate systematic overshoot. Overshoot therefore marks a **model breakdown point**: either (i) measurement noise, (ii) continued adaptation so that the effective target during retraining is not exactly the previous $S_T$, or (iii) both. The appropriate response is not to ignore overshoot, but to constrain the model’s domain: *use it to describe recovery up to an error-defined neighborhood of $S_T$.* 

A compact summary for Halonen et al. (PRT) is:

| Outcome (PRT)        | $S_T$ Week 10 | $S_D$ Week 20 | $S(5w)$ Week 25 | % diff at 5w vs $S_T$ | CV%  |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ---- |
| Leg press 1RM (kg)   | 197.6         | 187.5         | 201.5           | +1.97%                | 3.1  |
| Biceps curl 1RM (kg) | 34.2          | 32.8          | 35.1            | +2.63%                | 2.6  |
| VL CSA (cm$^2$)      | 30.3          | 27.2          | 30.2            | −0.33%                | 1.6  |
| BB CSA (cm$^2$)      | 10.6          | 9.8           | 10.7            | +0.94%                | 2.3  |

Values are taken from Table 3 (PRT) and reported CV%. 

To visualize the recovery-only modeling assumption, Figure 1 shows the normalized recovery fraction $R(t)$ for vastus lateralis CSA in the PRT group, alongside exponential and logistic recovery-only fits parameterized to match the Week 25 retraining value.

**Figure 1.** Normalized recovery fraction $R(t)$ for vastus lateralis CSA (PRT group). Both models assume a fixed target $S_T$ equal to the pre-detraining value (Week 10). 



**Interpretation.** Even with conservative error-aware framing (recovered = within test–retest CV), these outcomes support the claim that **practical recovery can occur within $\sim\!5$ weeks** in previously untrained adults undergoing structured retraining. The Week 30 observation ($R>1$) indicates departure from the recovery-only modeling assumption of a fixed $S_T$, rather than failure of the fitted dynamics within the recovery window.



### 2) Estimating rate constants when recovery is incomplete (Taaffe et al., 2009)

Taaffe et al. provides a 12-week retraining endpoint. For exercises where $S(12)$< $S_T$, a single endpoint can be used to compute an *implied* $k_r$ (exponential) or $k_l$ (logistic) that exactly matches that endpoint:

- Exponential:

$$
k_r=-\frac{1}{t}\ln\left(\frac{S_T-S(t)}{S_T-S_D}\right)
$$

- Logistic:

$$
k_l=\frac{1}{t}\ln\left(\frac{S(t)(S_T-S_D)}{(S_T-S(t))S_D}\right)
$$

(both with $t=12$ weeks).

| Exercise (older adults) | ($R(12)$) | ($k_r$) (exp, $wk^{-1}$) | ($k_l$) (logistic, $wk^{-1}$) |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Chest press             | 0.845     | 0.155                    | 0.169                         |
| Seated row              | 0.973     | 0.302                    | 0.316                         |
| Biceps curl             | 0.929     | 0.220                    | 0.243                         |
| Leg extension           | 0.806     | 0.137                    | 0.153                         |
| Leg press               | 1.006     | $N/A $  $(S(12)>S_T)$    | $N/A  $  $(S(12)>S_T)$        |
| Leg curl                | 1.000     | $N/A $  $  (S(12)=S_T)$  | $N/A $  $(S(12)=S_T)$         |

All underlying phase values are from Table 1. 

**Key point.** The implied $k$ values are close across models because a single endpoint does not meaningfully constrain curvature; it only constrains *how much* recovery occurred by $t=12$. This is exactly what the analytical linearization predicts. When $S(12)\ge S_T$ (complete recovery or slight overshoot), these endpoint-based formulas do not yield finite rate estimates under a fixed-target recovery-only assumption, so $k$ is reported as not applicable.

### 3) Strength–size dissociation as a modeling constraint (Psilander et al., 2019)

Psilander et al. reports that strength remained substantially elevated after detraining even when thickness/CSA returned toward baseline. 
 This implies that any single-variable $S(t)$ model must be interpreted carefully: for “strength,” $S_T$ is not purely a function of muscle size and may embed persistent neural adaptation. In other words, $S(t)$ for strength may have a “memory” component that is not erased by detraining at the same rate as morphology. 

## Limitations

1. **Sparse retraining sampling.** Many studies (including two used here) provide only a pre/post retraining endpoint, which mathematically prevents discrimination between exponential and logistic dynamics. The identifiability issue is structural, not statistical.
2. **Fixed-target assumption.** Observed overshoot relative to pre-detraining values suggests that $S_T$ is not a strict asymptote during retraining, at least at the resolution of group means and typical measurement error. Models that treat $S_T$ as a hard ceiling are best interpreted as **recovery-phase** models up to a tolerance band around $S_T$. 
3. **Outcome heterogeneity.** 1RM strength and ultrasound CSA reflect different underlying processes and may not share a single rate constant. Strength retention during detraining further complicates direct coupling of size and performance. 
4. **Between-study differences.** Training frequency, exercise selection, participant training history, and nutrition control vary across studies, limiting the interpretation of any single recovered $k$ value as a universal constant. 

**Future data requirements.** Discriminating exponential deficit recovery from logistic recovery requires denser sampling during the early retraining window, specifically multiple measurements while the recovery fraction remains below ~0.8 (i.e., before approaching the linearized regime near $S_T$). A practical minimum design is ≥5 retraining timepoints within the first 4–6 weeks (e.g., $t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6$ weeks), alongside repeated baseline tests to quantify within-subject measurement error (CV) for the chosen strength metric. Without early high-deficit observations and quantified test–retest variability, endpoint-only datasets constrain only “how much recovered by time $t$,” but not curvature, preventing meaningful model selection between exponential and logistic dynamics.

## Implications

1. **A usable quantitative object:** The normalized recovery fraction

$$
R(t)=\frac{S(t)-S_D}{S_T-S_D}
$$

is a compact way to compare recovery behavior across exercises, cohorts, and studies without conflating scale.

2. **A strict inference rule:** With only one retraining endpoint, it is reasonable to compute an implied $k$, but it is *not* reasonable to claim model superiority. The correct claim is: “these data are consistent with both models; discrimination requires denser sampling earlier in retraining.”

3. **Where the model is conceptually original:**

- It treats “muscle memory” as a **parameter-identification problem** rather than a slogan.
- It makes the **breakdown** (overshoot; strength–size dissociation) an explicit modeling signal: fixed-target, single-variable recovery is a *domain-limited approximation*, not a universal law. 

4. **Applied relevance:** A recovery-phase model with defensible error-aware thresholds can support planning contexts where the question is operational (“how long until I am back near my prior level?”) rather than mechanistic (“which cellular process caused it?”). This includes injury return-to-training contexts where the “target” is often a prior safe-performance benchmark rather than a true physiological maximum. 

## Conclusion

A minimal modeling investigation of post-detraining recovery can be built around a simple, explicitly stated target $S_T$, a detrained state $S_D$, and a recovery trajectory $S(t)$. A deficit-driven exponential model and a logistic alternative are both mathematically natural and physiologically interpretable. Critically, the models are **locally equivalent near recovery**, so most published datasets with sparse retraining measurements cannot discriminate mechanisms even if they show rapid regain. Application to published training–detraining–retraining data supports the practical observation that recovery to within test–retest error can occur within ~$5$ weeks in some settings, while overshoot and strength–size dissociation identify precise points where the fixed-target, single-variable assumption breaks and requires refinement.
