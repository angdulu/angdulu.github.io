My first attempt dates back to December 8, 2024, when I decided to create my own blog from scratchâ€”without knowing a single thing about coding. I thought I could do everything. I thought I could create my own Facebook or Google. 

I tried so hard, only to end up building something that could barely be called a blog. It was, honestly, a mess. This is what I ended up getting after like 100 hours of coding. ðŸ˜­

What was worse than the website was my coding skill. I had to literally rebuild the entire website every time I uploaded a single post. Knowing nothing about coding, even changing the title of the post was a pain.

Eventually, I gave up on using my handmade blogâ€”but I never gave up on researching, which had always been my ultimate goal. 

Today, 2025 Octobor 8, after days of researching and coding, I came up with the Github blog. I know it's not as majestic as a hand-made Facebook, Google, but I acknowleged my limits. I still hated using templates made for everyone. I wanted something that unique, representing me, and this is still the best i can think of. Sorry for letting you down (though I'm the only one reading this).
