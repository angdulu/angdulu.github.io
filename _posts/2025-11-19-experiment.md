Hello, I've got some bad news. 


 The *execution load* is too heavy right now:

- daily workouts

- precise calorie surplus

- 130–160g protein

- consistent sleep

- weekly testing

- documentation
  
   
  
   I'm a Grade 11 student with AP classes, college prep, etc. This is objectively too demanding.



The experiment should not be abandoned. It's only **postponed** until a period when I have stability (break / grade 12). 



## The Data Integrity Shift:

Also, I planned to track Muscle Mass as a secondary metric only for additional reference. However, the InBody machine at my gym is currently out of service, and as a dorm student, my ability to travel to other clinics for DEXA or high-end scans is limited. Rather than publishing 'noisy' or inaccurate data from a cheap scale, I have decided to focus strictly on my original  goal of **Strength Performance (1RM)**, which provides a much more objective measure of the muscle memory effect.




… I can still do research NOW (still meaningful)

> Use open-source data + existing studies to **model time vs % strength recovery**




## What I can build:

- A database of published muscle-memory timelines using 5–10 peer-reviewed studies.
- Extract time + % of regained strength
- Fit a curve (exponential recovery model)
- Create my own **formula**


It is going to look like

👉 **Phase 1 (now): computational model**

👉 **Phase 2 (later): experimental validation**



## My formula could help:

- Beginners who return from injury
- Athletes planning off-season recovery
- Coaches designing periodization
- Students in sports science classes
- Anyone curious about “How long until I gain my power back?”
  

## Current Plan: Minimal viable RESEARCH project 

- collect 5–10 studies
- extract:
  - length of detraining
  - time to recover
  - % strength regained
- plot data points
- fit a simple function
