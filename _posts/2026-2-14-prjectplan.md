## 10-Day Plan

### Day 1–2: Study Selection

Identify and secure **three high-quality human studies** that meet the following criteria:

- Clear detraining → retraining structure
- At least three retraining timepoints
- Explicit strength measurements

The emphasis is on dataset usability, not quantity.

The goal is to establish a clean, analyzable foundation.

------

### Day 3–5: Deep Analysis of One Study

One study will be fully analyzed.

Steps:

- Extract data into structured tables
- Compute normalized recovery function $R(t)$
- Perform exponential fitting
- Perform logistic fitting
- Compute RMSE
- Generate two core figures

Only one dataset will be completed at this level.

This phase marks the transition from conceptual design to actual modeling.

------

### Day 6–7: Formal Results Section

Draft a structured results section including:

- Estimated recovery constant $k_r$
- Deficit half-life calculation
- Logistic vs exponential comparison
- Model limitations and identifiability issues

At this stage, the project begins to resemble genuine quantitative research rather than an exploratory exercise.

------

### Day 8–9: Reproducibility Infrastructure

Organize:

- Clean dataset files
- Fitting scripts
- Clear documentation
- Reproducible workflow

Publish on GitHub with transparent structure.

Reproducibility is prioritized over volume of analysis.

------

### Day 10: Integrated Research Artifact

Produce a single consolidated PDF:

- 8–12 pages
- 3–4 figures
- Mathematical appendix
- No exaggerated claims

The document will not aim to present definitive conclusions.
 It will demonstrate methodological seriousness and analytical clarity.
